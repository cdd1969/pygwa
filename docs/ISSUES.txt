KNOWN BUGS AND ISSUES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1)
    Node: interpolateDf
    when loading Flowchart, the State is not fully restore. Children are not added.
    Probably this is comming from method *process* where all columns are deleted at first

2) (DONE)
    Node: plotTimeseries
    When dataIn is changed, it is onl updated on the upper subplot. To update it at the bottom, you need to
    reconnect the input terminal

3) (DISMISSED)
    Node: plotTimeseries
    PlotTimeseries currently works only with curves in which X-axes has been built with *datetime* objects

    UPD:
        I have decided that this should be the only possible behaviour

4) (DONE)
    Node: plotTimeseries
    PlotTimeseries does not update te colors of the points when a color of a curve is changed after it has been added
    the canvas

5) (DISMISSED)
    Node: readCSV
    Supports only certain datetime formats. For example, it will fail loading *24:00:00* (only 23:59:59 is
    accepted). To treat those annoying 24:00:00 you may use script */utils/remove_24h.py*

    dismissed comment: it is too much work to do that. let the user take care of that problem himself

6)
    General, Flowchart
    The changes in the Node-parameters doesnt provoke the *unsavedChanges* status. Currently it it toggled
    only when : a) node is added b) node is removed c) node is renamed

    UPD 15.02:
        Partly fixed, but now some unwanted signals `sigUIChanged` are emitted when data is processed

7)
    Function, Statistical Analysis
    Sometimes bugs appear when NaNs are passed. Check that out

8) (DONE)
    Node: viewPandasDf
    When clicking on columns (for selecting/deselecting them) - qtableview closes

9) (DONE)
    Node: detectPeaks_ts
    peak detection does not work as expected with keyword order
    i.e.
        a = [5, 4, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 4 , 5]
    it detects two minimum peaks at 1 and 1

    Check this code....
        import scipy.signal as sg
        import numpy as np
        a = [1.87, 1.97, 2.07, 2.17, 2.25, 2.35, 2.42, 2.47, 2.51, 2.53, 2.52, 2.53, 2.48]
        a = np.array(a)
        print sg.argrelextrema(a, np.greater_equal, order=10)
        # >>> (array([ 9, 11]),)
        # So that is our problem! We want only one peak!

    This problem has been fixed by introducing `order` parameter in <remove_region()>
    function in module lib.functions.detectpeaks

10) (DONE)
    Node: plotGWLvsWL
    Something is wrong with trendlines...
    Not working, sometimes KeyError, sometimes everythin's ok

11) (DONE)
    Node: timeseriesPlot/makeTimeseriesCurve
    When *timeseriesPlot* node is connected to *makeTimeseriesCurve*, and the legend is on
    whenever the column is changed in *makeTimeseriesCurve* it is not updated
    in legend...

12)
    GENERAL
    fix the warning below. Mostly in *process()* method of my custom nodes:

    ```Warning: use of node.terminalName is deprecated; use node['terminalName'] instead.```

13)
    LIBRARY
    After reloading the node library it becomes impossible to add new nodes to the flowchart
    if nodes of the same type have not already been added to the fc

14)
    NODE
    Nodes: +, -, /, *
    When the limits are changed, value is updated but it is not visialized in combobox!
    Old value stays there...
