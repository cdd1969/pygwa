KNOWN BUGS AND ISSUES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1)
    Node: interpolateDf
    when loading Flowchart, the State is not fully restore. Children are not added.
    Probably this is comming from method *process* where all columns are deleted at first

2) (DONE)
    Node: plotTimeseries
    When dataIn is changed, it is onl updated on the upper subplot. To update it at the bottom, you need to
    reconnect the input terminal

3)
    Node: plotTimeseries
    PlotTimeseries currently works only with curves in which X-axes has been built with *datetime* objects

4)
    Node: plotTimeseries
    PlotTimeseries does not update te colors of the points when a color of a curve is changed after it has been added
    the canvas

5)
    Node: readCSV
    Supports only certain datetime formats. For example, it will fail loading *24:00:00* (only 23:59:59 is
    accepted). To treat those annoying 24:00:00 you may use script */utils/remove_24h.py*

6)
    General, Flowchart
    The changes in the Node-parameters doesnt provoke the *unsavedChanges* status. Currently it it toggled
    only when : a) node is added b) node is removed c) node is renamed

7)
    Function, Statistical Analysis
    Sometimes bugs appear when NaNs are passed. Check that out

8) (DONE)
    Node: viewPandasDf
    When clicking on columns (for selecting/deselecting them) - qtableview closes

9) (DONE)
    Node: detectPeaks_ts
    peak detection does not work as expected with keyword order
    i.e.
        a = [5, 4, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 4 , 5]
    it detects two minimum peaks at 1 and 1

    Check this code....
        import scipy.signal as sg
        import numpy as np
        a = [1.87, 1.97, 2.07, 2.17, 2.25, 2.35, 2.42, 2.47, 2.51, 2.53, 2.52, 2.53, 2.48]
        a = np.array(a)
        print sg.argrelextrema(a, np.greater_equal, order=10)
        # >>> (array([ 9, 11]),)
        # So that is our problem! We want only one peak!

    This problem has been fixed by introducing `order` parameter in <remove_region()>
    function in module lib.functions.detectpeaks

10)
    Node: plotGWLvsWL
    Something is wrong with trendlines...
    Not working, sometimes KeyError, sometimes everythin's ok
