KNOWN BUGS AND ISSUES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1)
    Node: interpolateDf
    when loading Flowchart, the State is not fully restore. Children are not added.
    Probably this is comming from method *process* where all columns are deleted at first

2) (DONE)
    Node: plotTimeseries
    When dataIn is changed, it is onl updated on the upper subplot. To update it at the bottom, you need to
    reconnect the input terminal

3)
    Node: plotTimeseries
    PlotTimeseries currently works only with curves in which X-axes has been built with *datetime* objects

4)
    Node: plotTimeseries
    PlotTimeseries does not update te colors of the points when a color of a curve is changed after it has been added
    the canvas

5)
    Node: readCSV
    Supports only certain datetime formats. For example, it will fail loading *24:00:00* (only 23:59:59 is
    accepted). To treat those annoying 24:00:00 you may use script */utils/remove_24h.py*

6)
    General, Flowchart
    The changes in the Node-parameters doesnt provoke the *unsavedChanges* status. Currently it it toggled
    only when : a) node is added b) node is removed c) node is renamed

7)
    Function, Statistical Analysis
    Sometimes bugs appear when NaNs are passed. Check that out

8)
    Node: viewPandasDf
    When clicking on columns (for selecting/deselecting them) - qtableview closes
